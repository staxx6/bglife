:family: Background Life  - A game that runs in the background and where you sometimes make decisions.

## About
This game is mainly to learn C++. There will be no fancy graphics, only text (terminal) output. 
But I want to program this modular enough to have the possibility for 2D/3D output. 

Perhaps this game will be good enough that other people want to play this. :smile:

## Setup from source
